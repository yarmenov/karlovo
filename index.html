            <h2>Why Karlovo?</h2>
            <h3>Karlovo, the city of roses</h3>
            <p>
              Karlovo is famous for the worldwide-known rose oil, which is grown
              there and used in producing perfume. In addition to this, Karlovo
              is the birthplace of Vasil Levski, the most distinguished
              Bulgarian to start preparing the national liberation from the
              Ottoman rule in the late 19th century. There is a museum and large
              monument dedicated to him. Karlovo is also a popular location for
              tourism in the region.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the 2000s, Bulgarian archaeologists made discoveries in
              Central Bulgaria which were summarized as 'The Valley of the
              Thracian Kings'. On 19 August 2005, some archaeologists announced
              they had found the first Thracian capital, which was situated near
              Karlovo in Bulgaria. Many polished ceramic artifacts (pieces of
              roof-tiles and Greek-like vases) were discovered revealing the
              fortune of the town.

                <h4>Suchurum Waterfall</h4>
                <p>
                  "Suchurum" waterfall is located at the foot of Stara Planina
                  mountain, 1 kilometer north of town of Karlovo. Its waters
                  fall from 15 meters. You can swim there all year round if you
                  like cold exposure.
                </p>

                <p>Suchurum, Vodopad Street</p>
                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>
                  This is one of the best sightseeing spots in Karlovo and it
                  can get busy at weekends but if you go earlier in the day you
                  can get the whole waterfall to yourself and enjoy the peace
                  and quiet.

                <p>
                  The historic part of Karlovo is worth a visit with its cobbled
                  streets and traditional Bulgarian houses.

                <p>
                  The narrow cobble-stone alleys lead up to beautiful houses
                  built out of wood and stone in the style, typical of the
                  Bulgarian National Revival period. Five of these monuments of
                  culture, emblematic of the town itself, have been restored and
                  now form the Ancient Karlovo tourist area.
