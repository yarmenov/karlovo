            <h2>Why Karlovo?</h2>
            <h3>Karlovo, the city of roses</h3>
            <p>
              Karlovo is famous for the worldwide-known rose oil, which is grown
              there and used in producing perfume. In addition to this, Karlovo
              is the birthplace of Vasil Levski, the most distinguished
              Bulgarian to start preparing the national liberation from the
              Ottoman rule in the late 19th century. There is a museum and large
              monument dedicated to him. Karlovo is also a popular location for
              tourism in the region.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the 2000s, Bulgarian archaeologists made discoveries in
              Central Bulgaria which were summarized as 'The Valley of the
              Thracian Kings'. On 19 August 2005, some archaeologists announced
              they had found the first Thracian capital, which was situated near
              Karlovo in Bulgaria. Many polished ceramic artifacts (pieces of
              roof-tiles and Greek-like vases) were discovered revealing the
              fortune of the town.
